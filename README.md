# Flash Flood Forecasting System for West Africa

This repository contains code, documentation, data, and results from the research work done for NASA's SERVIR-West Africa project on developing a flash flood forecasting system in the West Africa domain.

This repository is split into 3 directories: data, EF5, GIS. 
Data contains all data used in the research or scripts to download the data (including IMERG satellite data, observational streamflow data, and collected evidence of flash flooding events). 
EF5 contains control files used for the West Africa domain, as well as the simulation outputs of max unit streamflow and discharge timeseries. 
GIS contains a GIS file with observational station locations, flash flood event locations, and EF5 output maps. There are also style files used to view the imported data files. 

For any questions, contact Abi Jones at amj2221@columbia.edu.
