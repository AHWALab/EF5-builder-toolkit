# Flash Flood Forecasting System for West Africa and Ghana

This repository contains code, documentation, data, and results from the research work done for NASA's SERVIR-West Africa project on developing a flash flood forecasting system in the West Africa domain (WA) (1km resolution) and Ghana domain (GH) (90m resolution).

This repository is split into 3 directories: DATA, EF5, CODES. 
**1. Data**: Contains all data used in the research for both WA domain and GH domain, such as observational streamflow data from different entities, and GIS files with observational station locations, flash flood event locations, and EF5 files (FAC, FDIR, DEM). An aditional .xlsx file with observational station details is provided for both WA and GH domain.
**2. EF5:** Contains control files used for the WA and GH domain, as well as the simulation outputs. 
**3. Codes:** Contains python codes created for posprocessing EF5 outputs, download IMERG v07 files.
