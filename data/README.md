# Flash Flood Forecasting System for West Africa: Data directory 

The Data repository contains all data used in the research (including IMERG satellite data, observational streamflow data, and collected evidence of flash flooding events). This directory contains the following:

- Downloaded daily GRDC (observational) river discharge data for all gauge stations in the West Africa domain. There is also a table of the locations of the GRDC stations.

- Python scripts to download early and final run 30 min precipitation accumulation IMERG satellite data. There is also a MATLAB script to produce PNG files of the IMERG data that can then be converted to animations in the command line, a shape file of the West Africa domain boundaries, and produced animations of 5 identified flash flood events (animations of 24hr and 3 day periods). 

- Observational streamflow data (daily data for 1999-2022) for gauge stations in Ghana, from the Ghana Hydrological Authority. 

- An excel spreadsheet containing information on data used. Including flash flood event sources, compiled lists of flash flooding events, identified flash flood events focused on in the research, EF5 simulation details, and GRDC station info.
